# rust-life
Rust implementation of Conway's Game of Life

## Useage
The program takes two arguments: the path to an input file containing a starting state, and the generation number to output.<br>
<br>
If the generation number is omitted the program will run in an animation mode where each generation will be displayed in the terminal until the program is stopped.
